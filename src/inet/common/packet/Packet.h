/**
 * This class represents network packets, datagrams, frames and other kinds of
 * data used by communication protocols. The underlying data structure supports
 * efficient construction, duplication, encapsulation, aggregation, fragmentation
 * and serialization. The data structure also supports dual representation by
 * default: data can be accessed as raw bytes and also as field based classes.
 *
 * Internally, packet stores the data in different kind of chunks. See the
 * Chunk class and its subclasses for details. All chunks are immutable in a
 * packet. Chunks are automatically merged as they are pushed into a packet,
 * and they are also shared among packets when duplicating.
 *
 * Packets are conceptually divided into three parts during processing: headers,
 * data, and trailers. These parts are separated by iterators which are stored
 * within the packet. During packet processing, as the packet is passed through
 * the protocol layers at the receiver, headers and trailers are popped from the
 * beginning and the end. This effectively reduces the remaining unprocessed
 * data part, but it doesn't affect the data stored in the chunks. Popping
 * headers and trailers is an efficient operation, because it doesn't require
 * copying or changing chunks, only updating the header and trailer iterators.
 *
 * In general, this class supports the following operations:
 *  - insert to the beginning or end
 *  - remove from the beginning or end
 *  - query the length of the whole, header, data, and trailer parts
 *  - peek, pop or remove an arbitrary chunk from the parts
 *  - serialize to and deserialize from a sequence of bits or bytes
 *  - copy to a new packet
 *  - convert to a human readable string
